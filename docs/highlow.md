## The "Ace Standard Coin" 
Before the draw, the dealer will _cup a flipped coin_ hereafter called the _"Ace Standard Coin"_

-_"Aces Low"_ means that an *Ace* are valued less than a *2*. 

## The Game Phases

###Shuffle
A shuffle from the _draw deck_ precedes every round.  The cards are drawn from the same deck round after round.  Before the start of the next round, the drawn cards are discarded to a _discard pile_.  Once there are no more cards left in the _draw deck_, the _discard pile_ is shuffled and replaces the _draw deck_.  This cycle continues until the game ends.

###Coin Flip
The dealer flips the _Ace Standard Coin_ and cups (hides) the result.

###Draw
Player draws 1 card from the top of the deck face up.
Dealer draws 1 card from the top of the deck face down. 

###Bet
Dealer informs the player of the minimum and maximum bet.

-Minimum: 10
-Maximum: Dealer's current credits

Player may raise the bet in incrememts of 10 to a max of either their maximum credits or the dealer's currently available credits, whichever is lower.
The Dealer will meet the players bet.
The players bet is removed from their available pool of credits to the _pot_.  The dealer also places their matching bet in the _pot_.

###Choice
The player chooses whether their card will be the _High_ card or the _Low_ card.

###Reveal
The _Ace Standard Coin_ is revealed.  This only affects rounds where either the dealer or the player have an Ace.
The Dealer's card is flipped face up.

###Decision
A comparison on the dealers card and the players card along with the players bet and the Ace Standard Coin value determines the winner.  The following are some examples of decisions.

- Player Bets High, Ace Standard Coin is High, Player's card is Ace, dealers card is King.  Player wins
- Player Bets Low, Ace Standard Coin is High, Player's card is Ace, dealers card is king. Player loses
- Player Bets High, Ace Standard Coin is Low, Player's card is Ace, dealer's card is Ace. Player and Dealer split the pot (push)
- Player Bets High, Players card is 10, Dealers card is 9. Player wins
- Player bets Low, Player's card is 3, Dealer's card is 2.  Player loses

##Example Game
-52 cards are shuffled.
-Dealer Flips a coin and cups it before it lands ("Aces High")
-Dealer deals 1 card to the player face up: "Ace of Hearts"
-Dealer deals 1 card to themselves face down, hidden from both the player and themselves.
-Dealer notifies the player that the minimum bet 10 can be increased in increments of 10 
-Player chooses to bet 20
-20 player credits are added to the pot
-20 dealer credits are added to the pot
-Dealer prompts the player to choose high or low.
-Player chooses "Low"
-Dealer reveals the _"Ace Standard Coin's"_ value: "Aces High"
-Dealer flips their card over: "5 of Diamonds"
-Player loses their bet and the pot is awarded to the dealer```

Result Explained
The player bet their card "Ace of Hearts" would be *Low*er and worth _LESS_ than the dealer's card.
Since the player's card is worth more, because the "Ace Standard Coin" value was "Aces High", player loses the bet.
