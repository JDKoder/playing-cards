1. Bet 
2. Deal starts the player with 2 cards face up and the dealer with 2 cards, 1 face up, the other face down
3. The player will be able to "hit" or be dealt another card, or stay, which will indicate the player will lock in their hand
    3. If the player hits and the card puts their hand value over 21 they immediately lose the round.
